# Graph: hypothesis-driven subset
graph:
  include:
    - "intent→requirements"     # hypothesis framing
    - "requirements→design"     # design sketch (not full design)
    - "design→code"             # prototype code
  skip:
    - "code↔unit_tests"         # throwaway code, no TDD
    - "design→uat_tests"        # no formal UAT
    - "code→cicd"               # no deployment

# Evaluators: agent + human (no deterministic — code is throwaway)
evaluators:
  default: [agent, human]
  overrides:
    "design→code":
      evaluators: [agent]       # no human review on prototype code

# Convergence: hypothesis confirmed/rejected OR time_box_expired
convergence:
  rule: "hypothesis_resolved_or_timeout"
  conditions:
    - hypothesis_confirmed       # human confirms feasibility
    - hypothesis_rejected        # human rejects feasibility
    - time_box_expired           # fold back partial results
