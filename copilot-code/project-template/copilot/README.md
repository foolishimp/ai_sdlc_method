# Copilot Config (Project Template)

Use this directory for Copilot-specific configuration:
- Stage prompt packs (requirements/design/tasks/code/system_test/uat/runtime).
- Shared instructions (Key Principles, TDD workflow, BDD patterns, REQ tagging, traceability checklist).
- Snippet definitions for tests, telemetry with REQ tags, ADR stubs, and task documentation.
- Optional scripts/hooks to trigger workspace commands (checkpoint/finish/release) from Copilot chat.

Align these configs with the solution design in `docs/design/copilot_aisdlc/`.***
