# SOURCE ANALYSIS CHECKS (Backward — analyse the requirements)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

source_analysis:

  - name: "requirements_ambiguities_identified"
    criterion: |
      Read the requirements document and identify every requirement that is
      ambiguous from a DESIGN perspective — requirements that could be
      satisfied by multiple incompatible architectures, unclear performance
      targets, undefined error semantics.
      Record each as SOURCE_AMBIGUITY.
    required: true

  - name: "requirements_gaps_for_design"
    criterion: |
      Identify information the requirements SHOULD contain for design but don't —
      missing data schemas, unspecified concurrency models, implied but unstated
      integration points, missing error handling requirements.
      Record each as SOURCE_GAP.
    required: true

  - name: "requirements_conflicting"
    criterion: |
      Identify requirements that conflict with each other or with
      project_constraints.yml (e.g., a performance requirement that
      contradicts a chosen technology stack). Record as SOURCE_AMBIGUITY.
    required: true

  # ─── Architecture quality ────────────────────────────────────────────

    source: default
    required: true

  - name: "dependencies_sound"
    type: agent
    criterion: |
      Dependencies are acyclic or justified.
      Dependencies respect $architecture.dependency_rules from project_constraints.

  # ─── ADR quality ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  - name: "adrs_for_decisions"
    type: agent
    criterion: |
      ADRs exist for every significant decision:
      - Technology choices (language, framework, library)
      - Pattern selections (architecture style, data access, error handling)
      - Trade-offs (performance vs simplicity, flexibility vs type safety)
      Each ADR must have: context, decision, alternatives considered, consequences.
    source: default
    required: true

  - name: "adr_depth_adequate"
    type: agent
    criterion: |
      ADRs are not shallow. Each must contain:
      - At least 2 alternatives considered (not just "we chose X")
      - Concrete consequences (not just "this is better")
      - Connection to specific REQ keys that drove the decision
      Minimum 1 ADR per 5 components, or 3 total — whichever is larger.

    required: true

  # ─── Document structure ──────────────────────────────────────────────

  - name: "document_has_required_sections"
    type: agent
    criterion: |
      Design document contains ALL required sections from document_structure:

      ADR Index, Package/Module Structure.
    source: default

  - name: "architecture_diagrams_present"

    criterion: |
      Design document includes Mermaid diagrams for:
      - System architecture (component relationships)
      - Data model (entity relationships)
      At minimum 2 diagrams. Diagrams must be consistent with the prose.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# CONTEXT GUIDANCE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

context_guidance:
  required:
    - "The requirements document (source asset)"
    - "project_constraints.yml (language, tools, architecture constraints)"
  recommended:
    - "Existing ADRs from project or related projects"
    - "Technology documentation for the chosen stack"
    - "Existing code if this is a redesign (understand current state)"
    - "Domain reference architectures or patterns"
  notes: |
    Design quality is heavily dependent on context.
    The same requirements with {Spark} context vs {dbt} context produce
    fundamentally different architectures. Ensure the right technology
    context is loaded before generating design.

  When designing from requirements:

  1. BUILD EFFECTIVE CHECKLIST (edge defaults + project architecture constraints)
  2. ANALYSE SOURCE (backward gap detection):
     - Read requirements thoroughly
     - Identify ambiguities from a design perspective
     - Identify missing information needed for design decisions
     - Identify conflicting requirements
     - Record all findings with classification and disposition
  3. GENERATE DOCUMENT following document_structure:
     - Architecture overview with Mermaid component diagram
     - Group requirements into components with clear interfaces
     - Data model with Mermaid entity diagram
     - Traceability matrix: component → REQ-* keys
     - Package/module structure
     - Generate ADRs for significant decisions (with alternatives and consequences)
  4. EVALUATE OUTPUT (forward gap detection) against checklist
  5. EVALUATE PROCESS (inward gap detection) — what evaluators or context are missing?
  6. Present to human for architecture review
  7. Report: source findings, checklist results, process gaps
