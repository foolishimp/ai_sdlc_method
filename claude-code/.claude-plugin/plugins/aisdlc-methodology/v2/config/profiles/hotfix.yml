# Graph: minimal — skip design, skip UAT, straight to code + tests
graph:
  include:
    - "intent→requirements"     # incident description
    - "design→code"             # fix implementation (design is inline)
    - "code↔unit_tests"         # regression test for fix
  skip:
    - "requirements→design"     # no formal design phase
    - "design→test_cases"       # no formal test cases
    - "design→uat_tests"        # no formal UAT
    - "code→cicd"               # manual deploy (or fast-track CI)

# Evaluators: deterministic (tests pass) + human (production verified)
evaluators:
  default: [deterministic, human]
  overrides:
    "intent→requirements":
      evaluators: [human]       # incident triage is human judgment
    "code↔unit_tests":
      evaluators: [deterministic]  # tests must pass, no human needed

# Convergence: fix verified in production
