## 23. Traceability Projections (v3.0 — code-coverage iteration)

### REQ-F-TRACE-001: Feature-Code Traceability Cross-Reference

**Priority**: High
**Traces To**: INT-GMON-006 (REQ key coverage visibility)

The system MUST scan project code and test files for REQ key tags (`# Implements: REQ-*` in code files, `# Validates: REQ-*` in test files) and produce a per-requirement coverage map showing which requirements have code implementations, test coverage, and full traceability.

---

## 24. Temporal Navigation (v3.0 — time-travel iteration)

### REQ-F-NAV-001: Event Log Temporal Query

**Priority**: High
**Traces To**: INT-GMON-007 (historical state visibility)

The system MUST support querying project state at arbitrary past timestamps by accepting a `?t=ISO8601` parameter and filtering the event log to events at or before that timestamp, enabling inspection of any historical project state.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: `?t=` query parameter accepted on all page and fragment routes
- AC-2: Event list filtered to `event.timestamp <= t` before any projection is computed
- AC-3: All projections (graph, convergence, features, gantt, edges) reflect the filtered event set
- AC-4: When `?t=` is absent or equals the latest event timestamp, live state is shown

### REQ-F-NAV-003: Feature State Reconstruction from Events

**Priority**: High
**Traces To**: INT-GMON-007 (event-sourced state reconstruction)

The system MUST reconstruct the complete feature vector state at a given timestamp by replaying a filtered event log, deriving edge trajectory statuses (in_progress, converged), iteration counts, and delta curves without reading feature YAML files.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: `reconstruct_features(events, timestamp_limit) → list[FeatureVector]` function implemented
- AC-2: `reconstruct_status(events, timestamp_limit) → StatusReport` function implemented
- AC-3: `edge_started` events set trajectory status to `in_progress`
- AC-4: `iteration_completed` events increment iteration count and append delta to delta_curve
- AC-5: `edge_converged` events set trajectory status to `converged`
- AC-6: Feature overall status derived from trajectory: all edges converged → `converged`, else `in_progress`

### REQ-F-NAV-007: Event Density Heatmap

**Priority**: Medium
**Traces To**: INT-GMON-007 (activity visualization)

The system MUST compute a normalized event activity density distribution across the project's event timeline, divided into configurable buckets, for use as a heatmap overlay in the temporal scrubber UI.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: `get_event_density(events, buckets=100) → list[float]` function implemented
- AC-2: Timeline divided into N equal time buckets between first and last event timestamps
- AC-3: Each bucket's count normalized to [0.0, 1.0] relative to the peak bucket
- AC-4: Returns `[0.0] * buckets` for empty event lists; `[1.0] * buckets` for zero-duration timelines
- AC-5: Output consumed by the global scrubber UI as `window.eventDensity`

---

## 25. Multi-Design Tenancy (v3.0 — multi-tenant iteration)

### REQ-F-MTEN-001: Design Tenant Filter

**Priority**: High
**Traces To**: INT-GMON-009 / OUT-033, OUT-035

The system MUST support filtering all dashboard views to a single design tenant via a `?design=` query parameter. When the parameter is present, only events whose `.project` field matches the tenant value are used to compute projections.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: `?design=` parameter accepted on the project detail page and all 14 fragment routes
- AC-2: When `?design=` is present, the event list, feature reconstruction, and status reconstruction are scoped to matching events only
- AC-3: When `?design=` is absent, the merged view of all events is shown (existing behaviour)
- AC-4: An unknown tenant value produces an empty (not errored) dashboard

### REQ-F-MTEN-002: Design Tenant Selector UI

**Priority**: High
**Traces To**: INT-GMON-009 / OUT-033, OUT-035

The system MUST render a tab bar on the project detail page showing all design tenants present in the event log, with per-tenant event counts. The active tenant is visually distinguished. An "All tenants" tab restores the unfiltered view.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: Selector nav rendered only when the project has events from more than one distinct `.project` value
- AC-2: Each tab shows the tenant name and its total event count `(N)` in a subdued annotation
- AC-3: The active tab carries `aria-current="page"` (Pico CSS native active state — no custom class needed)
- AC-4: "All tenants" tab links to the project URL with no `?design=` param; carries `aria-current="page"` when no design is active
- AC-5: Clicking a tenant tab performs a full page navigation (not HTMX swap) so all fragments reinitialise consistently

### REQ-F-MTEN-003: Design Filter Propagation

**Priority**: High
**Traces To**: INT-GMON-009 / OUT-034

The system MUST propagate the active design filter automatically to all HTMX fragment requests (including SSE-triggered reloads) and temporal scrubber reloads, without requiring per-fragment `hx-get` URL modifications.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-1: An HTMX `configRequest` event listener injects the `design` query parameter into the request parameters of every HTMX request when a tenant is active
- AC-2: The temporal scrubber's `triggerReload()` function includes `design=<tenant>` in the query string alongside `t=<timestamp>` when a tenant is active
- AC-3: The active design value is captured once at page load from `window.location.search`; full page navigation on tenant switch ensures the captured value is always current

## 28. OpenLineage Edge Traversal Timeline (v3.1 — lineage-primary iteration)

**Intent**: The primary view of the monitor is a time-series traversal of the event log as a sequence of **edge runs** — each edge run groups all events for one traversal of one graph edge for one feature. The user navigates time from inception to production, drilling from edge run → iteration → artifact → document/code/test.

OpenLineage provides the backbone: each OL event records `job` (the edge), `run.runId` (the run identity), `inputs`/`outputs` (source and produced assets), and `run.facets` (REQ keys, delta, event type). Together these constitute a complete provenance record.

### REQ-F-ELIN-001: Edge Run Grouping

**Statement**: Parse the event stream and group events into **edge runs** — sequences of events belonging to the same traversal of a specific (feature, edge) pair.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. An edge run is identified by the triple `(feature_id, edge_name, run_id)` where `run_id` comes from `run.runId` for OL events or is synthesised from `(feature, edge, edge_started timestamp)` for flat events.
2. An edge run is bounded by `edge_started` (open) and `edge_converged` / `command_error` / `transaction_aborted` (close). An unclosed run is `in_progress`.
3. Each edge run carries: start timestamp, end timestamp (if closed), status (`in_progress` / `converged` / `failed` / `aborted`), iteration count, final delta, list of iteration events, list of evaluator results.
4. Events that cannot be attributed to a run (no feature, no run_id) are collected into an `unattributed` bin.
5. Edge runs are sorted by `start_timestamp` ascending (chronological order).

### REQ-F-ELIN-002: Edge Traversal Timeline View

**Statement**: The monitor exposes an **Edge Traversal Timeline** view — a chronological list of all edge runs across all features, ordered by start time.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Each row displays: start time, feature ID, edge name, iteration count, delta at convergence, status badge, duration.
2. The timeline is filterable by: feature, edge name, status, time range.
3. Rows are grouped by date (day boundary) with a collapsible day header.
4. The view is accessible at `/project/{project_id}/timeline` and linked from the project dashboard nav.
5. Failed/aborted runs are visually distinguished (red badge) and sort to the top within their day group.

### REQ-F-ELIN-003: Iteration Drill-Down

**Statement**: Clicking an edge run in the timeline expands (inline) to show all iteration events for that run.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Each iteration row displays: iteration number, timestamp, delta, evaluator pass/fail/skip counts, status.
2. Each evaluator result is expandable to show: check name, type (F_D/F_P/F_H), result, expected vs observed (from `evaluator_detail` events).
3. The context hash is shown per iteration (from `iteration_completed.context_hash`).
4. `evaluator_detail` events for each iteration are linked by iteration number.
5. HTMX lazy-loads iteration details on expand (no full page reload).

### REQ-F-ELIN-004: Artifact Navigation from Events

**Statement**: From any edge run or iteration, the user can navigate to the produced artifact — the document, code file, or test file that was the output of that edge traversal.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Artifact links are extracted from OL `outputs[].name` (format: `file://path`) and from `_metadata.original_data.file_path`.
2. For each artifact link, the UI shows: file path (relative to project root), file type (inferred from extension: `.md`, `.py`, `.ts`, `.yml`, etc.), a link to the raw content view.
3. The raw content view renders the artifact at `/project/{project_id}/artifact?path={encoded_path}` — reads the file and renders it (markdown → HTML, code → syntax-highlighted).
4. If the artifact no longer exists on disk (deleted or moved), show a tombstone with the last-known path.
5. Artifact links are also available from the feature lineage view (REQ-F-FLIN-001).

### REQ-F-ELIN-005: Run Identity Threading via runId

**Statement**: OL `run.runId` and `run.facets.parent` enable causation threading — child events reference their parent run. The timeline uses this to show run hierarchies (e.g., an engine run triggered by an agent run).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. If an edge run's events contain `causation_run_id` or `parent_run_id` references, the run is shown as a child of its parent in the timeline.
2. Parent → child relationships are rendered as indented sub-rows in the timeline.
3. Orphaned children (parent not in the event log) are shown at top level with a warning badge.

---

## 29. Feature Lineage Drill-Down (v3.1 — lineage-primary iteration)

**Intent**: For a given REQ key, show the complete provenance path from spec definition through requirements, design, code, and tests — marrying the spec hierarchy with the time-series event record. The feature vector YAML is the index; the event log records when each edge was traversed.

### REQ-F-FLIN-001: Feature Lineage View

**Statement**: The monitor exposes a **Feature Lineage** view for each feature vector — the complete path from spec to production with timestamps and artifact links.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The view shows a vertical timeline of edges traversed by this feature, ordered by traversal start time.
2. Each edge row shows: edge name, start time, converged time (or in_progress), iterations, delta at convergence, artifact produced.
3. The view is accessible at `/project/{project_id}/feature/{feature_id}` and linked from any event that carries the feature's REQ key.
4. A summary header shows: feature ID, title, vector type (feature/spike/discovery/poc/hotfix), profile, current status, total edges traversed.
5. Each artifact produced at each edge is linked (see REQ-F-ELIN-004).

### REQ-F-FLIN-002: Spec-to-Artifact Cross-Navigation

**Statement**: From a feature's REQ key, the user can navigate to the spec section that defines it, and from each edge traversal, to the artifact produced at that edge.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The feature's REQ key is used to locate the defining section in `specification/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md` (or equivalent). A link to the spec section is shown in the feature header.
2. Each artifact in the lineage view carries its type: `spec` (intent/requirements), `design` (ADR/design doc), `code` (source module), `test` (unit/UAT test), `config` (YAML/config).
3. Artifact type is inferred from file path patterns: `specification/` → spec, `design/` or `adrs/` → design, `tests/` or `test_` → test, `src/` or `code/` → code.
4. The feature lineage view links to the `Implements: REQ-F-*` grep results (traceability view from REQ-F-TRACE-001).

### REQ-F-FLIN-003: Multi-Feature Convergence Map

**Statement**: The monitor exposes a **convergence map** — a matrix of features × edges showing convergence status for all features in one view, linked to individual feature lineage views.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Rows are features (REQ-F-* IDs), columns are graph edges (intent→req, req→design, etc.).
2. Each cell shows: status icon (converged/in_progress/pending/failed), iteration count if traversed, and links to the timeline view filtered to that (feature, edge) pair.
3. The map is accessible at `/project/{project_id}/convergence-map` and linked from the project dashboard.
4. Features are sorted by: status (failed first, then in_progress, then converged), then by feature ID.

---

## 30. Project as Evolution (v3.1 — lineage-primary shift)

**Intent**: The monitor is not a side-channel observer of a project — it IS the primary way to interact with a project. A project is its specification, its feature vectors, and its time-series evolution from inception. The codebase is one artifact among many; the event log is the authoritative record. Navigation is through evolution, not files.

This shifts the fundamental interaction model:
- **Before**: open IDE → browse code → understand project
- **After**: open monitor → browse evolution → understand project

The event log supports replay (reconstruct project state at any past moment), what-if analysis (branch from any past state, explore alternative trajectories), and vector direction exploration (from any state, what are the admissible next moves?).

### REQ-F-EVOL-001: Project State Reconstruction (Replay)

**Statement**: Given any timestamp T, the monitor can reconstruct the complete project state as it existed at T — which features were active, which edges had converged, what the spec said, what the delta was.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The temporal scrubber (REQ-F-NAV-001) selects a time window; all views reflect the state at the scrubber's upper bound.
2. "State at T" means: replay all events with `timestamp <= T` and derive the same projections (convergence, feature vectors, edge runs) from that subset.
3. The reconstructed state shows a "time-travel" indicator with the selected timestamp, distinguishing it from the live view.
4. Spec documents are shown as they existed at time T where possible (via git history if available, otherwise show current version with a warning).
5. The replay is read-only — no actions can be taken from a historical state view.

### REQ-F-EVOL-002: Feature Vector Directions

**Statement**: From any active feature vector, the monitor shows the **admissible next transitions** — the edges available from the current position in the graph, given the active profile.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. For each in-progress or pending feature, the monitor shows: current position in the graph (which edge was last traversed), next admissible transitions (from graph_topology.yml), and any blocked transitions (unresolved dependencies).
2. Admissible transitions are derived from the graph topology loaded at the project's `.ai-workspace/graph/graph_topology.yml`.
3. Each admissible transition shows: edge name, evaluator count, estimated complexity (from profile), whether it requires human approval (F_H evaluator present).
4. The current delta (failing required checks) is shown per feature to indicate readiness to advance.

### REQ-F-EVOL-003: What-If Branch Exploration

**Statement**: From any past edge run in the timeline, the user can open a "what-if" view — a hypothetical branch that replays the event stream from that point forward with a modified assumption.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Any edge run in the timeline has a "branch from here" action.
2. The what-if view shows: the project state at the branch point, the original trajectory taken, and an empty "alternative trajectory" lane.
3. The alternative trajectory lane shows what the graph topology says COULD have happened from this state — admissible transitions, unattempted paths, skipped edges.
4. What-if branches are ephemeral (not persisted) and clearly marked as hypothetical.
5. This is a read-only exploration tool — it does not modify the event log or any project files.

### REQ-F-EVOL-004: Specification Navigation

**Statement**: The monitor provides a navigable view of the specification hierarchy — from INTENT down through REQUIREMENTS, FEATURE DECOMPOSITION, DESIGN (ADRs), and into CODE and TESTS. Each spec node links to the events that implement it.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The spec navigator reads: `specification/INTENT.md`, `specification/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md`, feature vector YAMLs, and design ADRs.
2. Each REQ key in the spec is linked to: the feature vector that carries it, the code files tagged `Implements: REQ-*`, the test files tagged `Validates: REQ-*`, the edge runs that produced those artifacts.
3. The spec navigator is a collapsible tree: Intent → Requirements → Features → Design → Code → Tests.
4. Selecting any node highlights the related events in the timeline view (cross-view highlighting).
5. The spec navigator shows coverage: which REQ keys have code, tests, telemetry (green), which are partial (amber), which have nothing downstream yet (grey).

### REQ-F-FLIN-004: Projection Selector

**Statement**: All primary views (timeline, feature lineage, convergence map) support a **projection selector** — the user selects which subset of the event stream to view.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Projection options: `all` (full event log), `by-tenant` (filter by design tenant: imp_claude, imp_gemini, etc.), `by-profile` (filter by active profile: standard, poc, spike), `by-run` (single engine run, selected from a run list).
2. The selected projection is reflected in the URL as a query parameter (`?tenant=imp_claude&profile=standard`).
3. All views respect the active projection — event counts, convergence state, and artifact links are scoped to the projection.
4. The temporal scrubber (existing REQ-F-NAV-001) applies within the selected projection.
