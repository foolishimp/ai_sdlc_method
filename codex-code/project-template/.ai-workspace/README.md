# AI Workspace (Codex Template)

Workspace structure shared with the Claude template:
- `tasks/` (todo, active, finished, archive)
- `templates/` (task/session/method reference)
- `config/` (workspace configuration)

Copy this directory into Codex projects unchanged; commands and personas in Codex operate on the same files and formats. Use the existing templates from the root `.ai-workspace` or from `claude-code/project-template/.ai-workspace/` as needed.
