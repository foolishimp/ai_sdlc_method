# Codex Installers (Placeholder)

Purpose
- Future home for Codex installer scripts that set up the project template, commands, and plugins for the AISDLC method.

Planned Scripts
- `setup_workspace.py` – copy `.ai-workspace/` and validate structure. ✅ stubbed
- `setup_commands.py` – register `codex-sdlc-*` commands/configs. ✅ stubbed
- `setup_plugins.py` – install/update Codex AISDLC packages. ✅ stubbed
- `validate_traceability.py` – regenerate traceability artifacts (REQ → solution → implementation). ✅ stubbed

Status
- Stub implementations added; align full behavior with `docs/design/codex_aisdlc/` and mirror `claude-code/installers`.
