# GEMINI Context - Continuation

## Origin
This session is a continuation of the conversation from the `constraint_emergence_ontology` workspace.

## Objective
Working within `imp_gemini` to refine and expand its implementation.

## Mandates
- **Scope:** Work is strictly limited to the `imp_gemini` directory.
- **Reference:** Use `/Users/jim/src/apps/ai_sdlc_method/imp_claude` as a reference implementation.
- **Specification:** Adhere to the `ai_sdlc_method` specification.
- **History:** This implementation was originally built from an earlier specification and the `imp_claude` reference.

## Immediate Next Steps
- Analyze the current state of `imp_gemini`.
- Identify gaps or improvements based on the latest specifications/reference.
- Proceed with implementation and validation.
