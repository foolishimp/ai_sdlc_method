  Universal observer/evaluator composition law: IntentEngine(intent+affect) =
  observer → evaluator → typed_output(reflex.log | specEventLog | escalate).
  Fractal processing on every edge, ambiguity classification as routing criterion,
  three exhaustive output types, chaining with affect propagation,
  consciousness-as-relative. Not a fifth primitive — a composition law over the
  existing four (Graph, Iterate, Evaluators, Spec+Context).
  Constraint tolerances: every constraint has a measurable threshold; tolerances
  make the gradient operational; breach produces delta > 0 which drives intent.
  Without tolerances there is no homeostasis.
