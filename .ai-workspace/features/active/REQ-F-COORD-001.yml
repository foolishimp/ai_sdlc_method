description: |
  Multi-agent coordination protocol: event-sourced claims via inbox/serialiser
  pattern (no lock files), role-based authority, work isolation via design
  tenants, exactly-one-writer invariant per feature+edge. Supports single-agent
  and multi-agent modes with the same protocol. Agents claim edges via
  edge_claim events; serialiser resolves conflicts deterministically.
