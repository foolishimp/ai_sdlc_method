  Two-command UX layer: /aisdlc-start (state-driven routing) and
  /aisdlc-status (full observability). Start detects project state,
  selects features, delegates to iterate. Status shows progress,
  Gantt chart, process telemetry, self-reflection. Progressive init
  with ≤5 questions. Deferred constraint dimensions to design edge.
  8-state machine for Start routing.
