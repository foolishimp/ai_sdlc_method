description: |
  Continuous interoceptive and exteroceptive monitoring with affect triage
  pipeline, running as a long-running MCP service with review boundary for
  draft-only autonomy. Interoception observes the system's own health
  (event freshness, test staleness, vector stalls, build health, spec/code
  drift). Exteroception observes the external environment (dependency
  updates, CVE feeds, runtime telemetry, API changes). Affect triage
  classifies, weights, and escalates signals through the three processing
  phases (reflex -> affect -> conscious). Runs independently of iterate().
  Review boundary separates autonomous sensing from human-approved changes.
