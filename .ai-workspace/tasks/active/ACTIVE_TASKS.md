## Session Decisions (2026-02-20)

Key decisions made during design review session:

1. **Bootstrap graph committed**: Intent → Spec → Design → Code ↔ Tests → UAT → CI/CD → Telemetry
2. **Spec/Design separation**: Spec = WHAT (tech-agnostic), Design = HOW (tech-bound, ADRs, ecosystem). One spec, many designs.
3. **Feature lineage in code AND telemetry**: REQ keys thread from spec to runtime. `# Implements: REQ-*` in code, `req="REQ-*"` in telemetry.
4. **Feature views generated at every stage**: `/aisdlc-trace` greps REQ keys across artifacts to produce feature-level status.
5. **Multiple implementations per feature**: REQ-GRAPH-001 can have design.claude, design.codex, design.rust — same spec, different designs. Telemetry enables data-driven variant selection.
6. **Hilbert space is real**: Feature implementations are vectors with Hamiltonian cost metric (T=iteration cost, V=constraint delta). Evolution trajectory is observable and rollbackable.
7. **v1.x pruned**: Tag `v1.x-final` preserves ~940 files. Repo now 41 files, pure v2.1.
8. **README.md and CLAUDE.md rewritten** for v2.1.

## Task #38: Review and Refine v2.1 Spec

**Priority**: High
**Status**: Not Started
**Release Target**: 2.1

**Description**:
Review the spec documents against session decisions. The formal system was written before the Spec/Design separation, bootstrap graph, and feature lineage decisions were made. The spec needs to reflect these refinements.

**Work Breakdown**:
1. Review AI_SDLC_ASSET_GRAPH_MODEL.md — does the graph match the bootstrap graph?
2. Review PROJECTIONS_AND_INVARIANTS.md — do projection profiles match the committed flow?
3. Add Spec/Design boundary concept (tech-agnostic vs tech-bound) explicitly
4. Add feature lineage in telemetry as a formal requirement
5. Add feature views concept (generated traceability at each stage)
6. Update AISDLC_IMPLEMENTATION_REQUIREMENTS.md if needed
7. Regenerate PDFs after updates

## Task #32: Projection Profiles and Vector Type Support

**Priority**: High
**Status**: Not Started
**Release Target**: 2.1

**Description**:
Turn the projection and vector type concepts from PROJECTIONS_AND_INVARIANTS.md into working configs and agent support. Currently prose — needs to become implementation.

**Work Breakdown**:

1. Projection profile YAML configs — 6 named profiles (full, standard, poc, spike, hotfix, minimal) as `v2/config/profiles/*.yml`
2. Vector type support in iterate agent — extend `aisdlc-iterate.md` to handle discovery/spike/PoC convergence criteria
3. Spawning mechanism — `/aisdlc-feature --type spike` or `/aisdlc-spawn` to create child vectors with fold-back tracking
4. Fold-back mechanism — child vector outputs update parent's Context[] and unblock
5. Time-boxing support — `time_box` field in feature vector template, check-in cadence, expiry handling
6. "10-minute build" projection — simplest useful projection (intent → code, agent evaluator only). Prove it works.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] At least 3 projection profile YAMLs pass validation
- [ ] Iterate agent handles discovery vector convergence (question_answered)
- [ ] Time-box field in feature vector template
- [ ] End-to-end: spawn a spike from a feature, fold back results

## Task #33: Dogfood on Real Project

**Priority**: High
**Status**: COMPLETE (2026-02-20)
**Release Target**: 2.1

**Description**:
Use `/aisdlc-init` on an actual codebase, run `/aisdlc-iterate` on real edges, validate that the checklist composition and $variable resolution actually work. First real test of v2.1.

**Result**: Dogfooded on `~/src/apps/aisdlc-dogfood/` (Python CLI bookmark manager). Traversed 3 edges (intent→requirements→design→code). Found 6 bugs, all fixed. See `.ai-workspace/tasks/finished/20260220_dogfood_task33.md` for full findings.

## Task #36: Automated Traceability Validation

**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Not Started
**Release Target**: 2.1
**Informed by**: v1.x WU-032 (REQ-TRACE-003), WU-042 (REQ-TOOL-007)

**Description**:
Implement deterministic evaluator checks that automatically validate REQ key coverage. Feature views are generated by grepping — this task makes that a formal evaluator.

Two checks:
1. **REQ tag coverage** — grep code for `Implements: REQ-*`, grep tests for `Validates: REQ-*`, compare against spec feature list. Report missing coverage.
2. **Test gap analysis** — for each REQ key in spec, verify at least one test references it. Report untested requirements.
3. **Telemetry gap analysis** — for each REQ key in code, verify telemetry tagging exists. Report unmonitored features.

## Task #37: Ecosystem E(t) as Feedback Loop Edge

**Priority**: Low
**Status**: Not Started
**Release Target**: 2.2+
**Informed by**: v1.x Task #12 (Ecosystem E(t) Tracking)

**Description**:
Reframe the v1.x E(t) concept for v2.1. Ecosystem state is Context[]. Ecosystem changes spawn new intents via the feedback loop.

---

## Task #34: Propagate Insights Back to Ontology

**Priority**: Low
**Status**: Not Started
**Informed by**: PROJECTIONS_AND_INVARIANTS.md §10.3

**Description**:
Four insights from v2.1 that should propagate to the constraint-emergence ontology repo:
1. Invariants as projection survival criteria (extends #9)
2. Vector type diversity (extends #15)
3. Fold-back as context enrichment (extends #16)
4. Time-boxing as bounded iteration (extends #15)

---

## Backlog (Low Priority)

- **Release management command** — `/aisdlc-release` for framework versioning, changelog, git tagging.
- **LLM-specific prompting Context[]** — different LLM families may need different Context[] for optimal iterate performance.
- **Homeostasis model** — formalise the running system's self-monitoring as a feedback loop edge.
- **Multiple design variants** — support for multiple implementations per REQ key with telemetry-driven variant selection.

## Summary

| Status | Count |

- Low: #37 (Ecosystem E(t)), #34 (Ontology Propagation)

**Recommended next**: #38 (Review Spec) → #32 (Projections)
