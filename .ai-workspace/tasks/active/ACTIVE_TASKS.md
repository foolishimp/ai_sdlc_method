## Session Decisions (2026-02-20)

Key decisions made during design review session:

1. **Bootstrap graph committed**: Intent → Spec → Design → Code ↔ Tests → UAT → CI/CD → Telemetry
2. **Spec/Design separation**: Spec = WHAT (tech-agnostic), Design = HOW (tech-bound, ADRs, ecosystem). One spec, many designs.
3. **Feature lineage in code AND telemetry**: REQ keys thread from spec to runtime. `# Implements: REQ-*` in code, `req="REQ-*"` in telemetry.
4. **Feature views generated at every stage**: `/aisdlc-trace` greps REQ keys across artifacts to produce feature-level status.
5. **Multiple implementations per feature**: REQ-GRAPH-001 can have design.claude, design.codex, design.rust — same spec, different designs. Telemetry enables data-driven variant selection.
6. **Hilbert space is real**: Feature implementations are vectors with Hamiltonian cost metric (T=iteration cost, V=constraint delta). Evolution trajectory is observable and rollbackable.
7. **v1.x pruned**: Tag `v1.x-final` preserves ~940 files. Repo now 41 files, pure v2.1.
8. **README.md and CLAUDE.md rewritten** for v2.1.

## Task #38: Review and Refine v2.1 Spec

**Priority**: High
**Status**: COMPLETE (2026-02-20)
**Release Target**: 2.1

**Description**:
Review the spec documents against session decisions.

**Result**: All 4 spec documents updated. Added: Spec/Design boundary (§2.6), multiple implementations (§2.7), feature lineage in telemetry (§6.3), feature views (§6.4). 3 new requirements (REQ-LIFE-004, REQ-TOOL-009, REQ-TOOL-010) — total now 35. All PDFs regenerated.

## Task #32: Projection Profiles and Vector Type Support

**Priority**: High
**Status**: COMPLETE (2026-02-20)
**Release Target**: 2.1

**Description**:
Turn the projection and vector type concepts from PROJECTIONS_AND_INVARIANTS.md into working configs and agent support. Currently prose — needs to become implementation.

**Result**: All 6 projection profile YAMLs created (full, standard, poc, spike, hotfix, minimal). Iterate agent extended with extended convergence (question_answered, time_box_expired), spawn detection, and profile awareness. New `/aisdlc-spawn` command created for child vector spawning with fold-back. Feature vector template updated with vector_type, profile, time_box, and parent/children fields. Init command updated to scaffold profiles and fold-back directories.

**Deliverables**:
- 6 profile YAMLs: `v2/config/profiles/{full,standard,poc,spike,hotfix,minimal}.yml`
- Extended iterate agent: vector types, extended convergence, spawn detection, profile loading
- New command: `v2/commands/aisdlc-spawn.md` (child vector spawning + fold-back)
- Updated feature vector template: vector_type, profile, time_box, parent/children
- Updated iterate command: --profile flag, extended convergence, spawn handling
- Updated init command: profiles + fold-back directory scaffolding
- Updated plugin.json: new command + profiles config

## Task #33: Dogfood on Real Project

**Priority**: High
**Status**: COMPLETE (2026-02-20)
**Release Target**: 2.1

**Description**:
Use `/aisdlc-init` on an actual codebase, run `/aisdlc-iterate` on real edges, validate that the checklist composition and $variable resolution actually work. First real test of v2.1.

**Result**: Dogfooded on `~/src/apps/aisdlc-dogfood/` (Python CLI bookmark manager). Traversed 3 edges (intent→requirements→design→code). Found 6 bugs, all fixed. See `.ai-workspace/tasks/finished/20260220_dogfood_task33.md` for full findings.

## Task #36: Automated Traceability Validation

**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: COMPLETE (2026-02-20)
**Release Target**: 2.1
**Informed by**: v1.x WU-032 (REQ-TRACE-003), WU-042 (REQ-TOOL-007)

**Description**:
Implement deterministic evaluator checks that automatically validate REQ key coverage. Feature views are generated by grepping — this task makes that a formal evaluator.

**Result**: Created 3-layer traceability validation system as formal evaluator checks. Layer 1: REQ tag coverage (code has Implements tags, tests have Validates tags). Layer 2: Test gap analysis (every REQ key has tests). Layer 3: Telemetry gap analysis (every REQ key has telemetry tagging). New traceability.yml edge config created. Checks composed into design→code (Layer 1), code↔unit_tests (Layers 1+2), and telemetry→intent (Layer 3) edges. Enhanced /aisdlc-gaps command with --layer, --scope, --feature flags and structured evaluator reporting.

## Task #37: Ecosystem E(t) as Feedback Loop Edge

**Priority**: Low
**Status**: Not Started
**Release Target**: 2.2+
**Informed by**: v1.x Task #12 (Ecosystem E(t) Tracking)

**Description**:
Reframe the v1.x E(t) concept for v2.1. Ecosystem state is Context[]. Ecosystem changes spawn new intents via the feedback loop.

---

## Task #34: Propagate Insights Back to Ontology

**Priority**: Low
**Status**: Not Started
**Informed by**: PROJECTIONS_AND_INVARIANTS.md §10.3

**Description**:
Four insights from v2.1 that should propagate to the constraint-emergence ontology repo:
1. Invariants as projection survival criteria (extends #9)
2. Vector type diversity (extends #15)
3. Fold-back as context enrichment (extends #16)
4. Time-boxing as bounded iteration (extends #15)

---

## Backlog (Low Priority)

- **Release management command** — `/aisdlc-release` for framework versioning, changelog, git tagging.
- **LLM-specific prompting Context[]** — different LLM families may need different Context[] for optimal iterate performance.
- **Homeostasis model** — formalise the running system's self-monitoring as a feedback loop edge.
- **Multiple design variants** — support for multiple implementations per REQ key with telemetry-driven variant selection.

---

## Summary

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Not Started | 2 |
| Complete | 4 |
| Backlog | 4 |

**Priority**:
- Low: #37 (Ecosystem E(t)), #34 (Ontology Propagation)

**Recommended next**: #37 (Ecosystem E(t)) or #34 (Ontology Propagation) — both low priority, deferred
