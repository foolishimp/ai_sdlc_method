summary: |
  Gradient unification — homeostasis and consciousness unified under
  single delta(state, constraints) → work at every scale. REQ-LIFE-009
  added (Spec Review as Gradient Check). Codex review findings addressed.

changes:
  spec_refactoring:
    - "§7 restructured: 7 sections → 7 sections (new structure)"
    - "§7.1 The Gradient — single operation at every scale"
    - "§7.2 Gradient at Production Scale (merged old §7.2-7.3)"
    - "§7.3 Spec Review as Stateless Gradient Check (replaced consciousness loop §7.7.1-7.7.3)"
    - "§7.4 Event Sourcing (renumbered from §7.5)"
    - "§7.5 Methodology Self-Observation (renumbered from §7.6)"
    - "§7.6 The Living System (merged old §7.7.5-7.7.6)"
    - "§7.7 Protocol Enforcement Hooks (renumbered from §7.8)"
    - "§8 concept mapping updated (homeostasis, consciousness, maturity rows)"
    - "§10 summary points 14 and 16 rewritten"
    - "§11.2 cross-reference to §7.1 added"

  new_requirement:
    - "REQ-LIFE-009: Spec Review as Gradient Check — stateless delta(workspace, spec) → intents"

  consistency_fixes:
    - "INTENT.md: counts 49/54 → 55, version v3.6 → v3.7, terminology updated"
    - "AISDLC_V2_DESIGN.md: §1.7 renamed to Gradient at Spec Scale, feature count 8→10"
    - "Plugin README.md: 3 broken relative links fixed"
    - "5 tests updated: count assertions 54→55, terminology alignment"
    - "REQ-F-LIFE-001.yml: added REQ-LIFE-009, description updated"

  terminology:
    - "Homeostasis (production only) → Gradient at system scale"
    - "Consciousness loop → Spec review / gradient at spec scale"
    - "Three phases of maturity → Progressive gradient activation"
    - "Absorbing boundary → Constraint surface"
