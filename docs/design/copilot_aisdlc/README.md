# Copilot AISDLC Solution

Status: Draft (platform-aligned design for GitHub Copilot on VS/VS Code)

Purpose
- Provide a Copilot-native implementation of the AI SDLC Method, mirroring Claude and Codex solutions with prompts, snippets, and helper scripts.
- Preserve requirement traceability (REQ-F-*, REQ-NFR-*) while enabling Copilot workflows.

Artifacts
- `requirements.yaml` – Requirements covered by this solution.
- `design.md` – Architecture and integration approach for Copilot.
- `AISDLC_IMPLEMENTATION_DESIGN.md` – Detailed implementation design.
- `adrs/` – Platform-specific decisions (ADR-301+).

Usage
- Use this folder as the design reference for building or invoking the Copilot implementation of AISDLC.
- Keep REQ links and ADRs updated as Copilot tooling evolves.
