## Context Auto-Loading

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses an **implicit session model** where context loads automatically when Claude Code starts.

### What Auto-Loads

When you open this project in Claude Code, the following context is automatically available:

1. **This file (CLAUDE.md)** - Project guide, methodology overview, development guidelines
2. **Method Reference** - `.ai-workspace/templates/AISDLC_METHOD_REFERENCE.md` (workspace structure, workflow patterns)
3. **Active Tasks + Work Context** - `.ai-workspace/tasks/active/ACTIVE_TASKS.md` (single file with everything)

**One File. That's It.**

### No Explicit Session Start Needed

**You do NOT need to run `/aisdlc-start-session`** - that command has been removed.

- **Session = Context** - Your "session" is simply your current working context
- **Context persists** - Automatically saved via `/aisdlc-checkpoint-tasks`
- **No ceremony** - Just open Claude and start working
- **One file** - ACTIVE_TASKS.md has both tasks and work context

### How It Works

```
Open Claude → CLAUDE.md mentions ACTIVE_TASKS.md → Work → /aisdlc-checkpoint-tasks → Close
                          ↑                                         ↓
                          └──────── Context persists in one file ──┘
```

### The One File: ACTIVE_TASKS.md

This single file contains:
- **Active Tasks** - All your current work items with status
- **Summary** - Task counts and recently completed
- **Recovery Commands** - Quick commands to regain context

Simple. Just tasks. Context comes from conversation history.

### Checkpointing Your Work

Use **`/aisdlc-checkpoint-tasks`** to save your work:
- Updates task status (completed, in-progress, blocked)
- Creates finished task documentation for completed work
- Updates ACTIVE_TASKS.md with current state
- Moves completed tasks to "Recently Completed" section

### Quick Recovery

If you need to quickly understand where you are:
```bash
cat .ai-workspace/tasks/active/ACTIVE_TASKS.md  # Everything is here
git status                                       # Current git state
```

## Requirement Traceability Example

```
Intent: INT-001 "Customer self-service portal"
  ↓
Requirements: REQ-F-AUTH-001 "User login with email/password"
  ↓
Design: AuthenticationService → REQ-F-AUTH-001
  ↓
Tasks: PORTAL-123 (Jira ticket) → REQ-F-AUTH-001
  ↓
Code: auth_service.py
      # Implements: REQ-F-AUTH-001
      def login(email, password):
          ...
  ↓
Tests: test_auth.py # Validates: REQ-F-AUTH-001
       auth.feature # BDD: Given/When/Then for REQ-F-AUTH-001
  ↓
UAT: UAT-001 → REQ-F-AUTH-001 (Business sign-off ✅)
  ↓

Claude will guide you through:
1. Requirements: Generate REQ-F-AUTH-001, REQ-NFR-PERF-001, etc.
2. Design: Create AuthenticationService component, API specs
3. Tasks: Break into Jira tickets (PORTAL-123) with REQ tags
4. Code: TDD implementation (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
5. System Test: BDD scenarios (Given/When/Then)
6. UAT: Business validation test cases
7. Runtime Feedback: Setup telemetry with REQ key tagging
```

### Running Examples

```bash
# See complete 7-stage example
cd examples/local_projects/customer_portal
cat README.md  # 800+ line walkthrough
cat config/config.yml  # 650+ line agent configuration
```

### Accessing the Methodology

```python
from pathlib import Path
import yaml

# Load 7-stage methodology configuration
stages_config = Path("plugins/aisdlc-methodology/config/stages_config.yml")
with open(stages_config) as f:
    methodology = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Access stage specifications
requirements_stage = methodology['ai_sdlc']['stages']['requirements']
code_stage = methodology['ai_sdlc']['stages']['code']

# Get agent configuration
requirements_agent = requirements_stage['agent']
print(f"Role: {requirements_agent['role']}")
print(f"Purpose: {requirements_agent['purpose']}")

# Get Key Principles principles
key.principles = code_stage['key.principles']
print(f"TDD Workflow: {key.principles['tdd']['workflow']}")
```

## Development Methodology

**IMPORTANT**: This project follows the **Key Principles** principles, which are now integrated as the foundation for the Code stage (Section 7.0) in the complete 7-stage AI SDLC methodology.

### The Key Principles

1. **Test Driven Development** - "No code without tests"
2. **Fail Fast & Root Cause** - "Break loudly, fix completely"
3. **Modular & Maintainable** - "Single responsibility, loose coupling"
4. **Reuse Before Build** - "Check first, create second"
5. **Open Source First** - "Suggest alternatives, human decides"
6. **No Legacy Baggage** - "Clean slate, no debt"
7. **Perfectionist Excellence** - "Best of breed only"

**Ultimate Mantra**: **"Excellence or nothing"** 🔥

👉 **Read Full Principles**: [plugins/aisdlc-methodology/docs/principles/KEY_PRINCIPLES.md](plugins/aisdlc-methodology/docs/principles/KEY_PRINCIPLES.md)

### TDD Workflow (Code Stage)

**Always follow**: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → COMMIT

1. **RED**: Write failing test first
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality
4. **COMMIT**: Save with clear message (tagged with REQ key)
5. **REPEAT**: Next test

**No code without tests. Ever.**

👉 **Read Full Workflow**: [plugins/aisdlc-methodology/docs/processes/TDD_WORKFLOW.md](plugins/aisdlc-methodology/docs/processes/TDD_WORKFLOW.md)

### Before You Code (7 Questions)

Ask these seven questions:

1. Have I written tests first? (Principle #1)
2. Will this fail loudly if wrong? (Principle #2)
3. Is this module focused? (Principle #3)
4. Did I check if this exists? (Principle #4)
5. Have I researched alternatives? (Principle #5)
6. Am I avoiding tech debt? (Principle #6)
7. Is this excellent? (Principle #7)

**If not "yes" to all seven, don't code yet.**

## Development Guidelines

### Implementing a New Feature (7-Stage Process)

1. **Requirements Stage**: Generate REQ-* keys
   ```yaml
   - REQ-F-AUTH-001: "User login with email/password"
   - REQ-NFR-PERF-001: "Login response < 500ms"
   - REQ-DATA-001: "Email must be valid format"
   ```

2. **Design Stage**: Create technical solution
   ```yaml
   Component: AuthenticationService
   API: POST /api/v1/auth/login
   Data Model: User table (email, password_hash)
   Dependencies: ValidationService, TokenService
   ```

3. **Tasks Stage**: Break into work units
   ```yaml
   - PORTAL-123: Implement AuthenticationService (REQ-F-AUTH-001)
   - PORTAL-124: Add validation (REQ-DATA-001)
   - PORTAL-125: Optimize performance (REQ-NFR-PERF-001)
   ```

4. **Code Stage**: TDD implementation
   ```python
   # RED: Write failing test
   def test_user_login_with_valid_credentials():
       user = create_test_user()
       result = login(user.email, "password123")
       assert result.success == True

   # GREEN: Implement minimal solution
   # Implements: REQ-F-AUTH-001
   def login(email: str, password: str) -> LoginResult:
       user = User.get_by_email(email)
       if user and user.check_password(password):
           return LoginResult(success=True, user=user)
       return LoginResult(success=False)

   # REFACTOR: Improve code quality
   # (Add logging, error handling, type hints, etc.)

   # COMMIT: Save with REQ tag
   git commit -m "Add user login (REQ-F-AUTH-001)"
   ```

5. **System Test Stage**: BDD scenarios
   ```gherkin
   Feature: User Authentication
     # Validates: REQ-F-AUTH-001

     Scenario: Successful login
       Given I am on the login page
       When I enter valid email "user@example.com"
       And I enter valid password "password123"
       And I click "Login"
       Then I should see "Welcome back"
   ```

6. **UAT Stage**: Business validation
   ```yaml
   UAT-001:
     title: "Validate user login flow"
     requirement: REQ-F-AUTH-001
     tester: Business Analyst
     status: APPROVED ✅
   ```

7. **Runtime Feedback Stage**: Telemetry
   ```python
   # Tag metrics with requirement keys
   logger.info("User login", extra={
       "requirement": "REQ-F-AUTH-001",
       "latency_ms": 120,
       "success": True
   })

   # If production issue occurs
   Alert: "ERROR: REQ-F-AUTH-001 - Auth timeout"
   → Traces back to requirements
   → Generates new intent: INT-042 "Fix auth timeout"
   ```

### Code Standards

- **Tests first** (always RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- **Tag code with REQ keys** (# Implements: REQ-F-AUTH-001)
- Use type hints
- Follow PEP 8 (for Python projects)
- Add docstrings to all public methods
- Keep functions focused and small
- No technical debt
- Excellence or nothing

## Plugin System

### Creating a Project Plugin

See [PLUGIN_GUIDE.md](PLUGIN_GUIDE.md) for complete guide.

**Quick example:**

```yaml
# .claude-plugins/my-project/config.yml
ai_sdlc:
  methodology_plugin: "file://plugins/aisdlc-methodology/config/stages_config.yml"

  enabled_stages:
    - requirements
    - design
    - tasks
    - code
    - system_test
    - uat
    - runtime_feedback

  stages:
    code:
      testing:
        coverage_minimum: 90
      key.principles:
        enabled: true
```

### Federated Architecture

```
Corporate Marketplace
  ├─ aisdlc-methodology (v2.0.0)
  └─ python-standards (v1.0.0)
       ↓
Division Marketplace
  ├─ backend-standards
  └─ payment-services-standards
       ↓
Project Plugin
  └─ payment-gateway-context
```

Plugin loading order determines priority - later plugins override earlier ones.
